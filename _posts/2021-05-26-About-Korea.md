April 23rd 2021 I landed in Korea... In the middle of a global pandemic. 
And thus started the 2 week mandated self isolation, essentially 2 weeks of complete boredom.
On the 7th of may I got a text saying that I was able to leave quarantine!!! wahooo the outside world here I come!
However, the town I'm currently living in isnt the most busttling in South Korea.
I did my best to start to explore the town but where I say there isn't much here... there really isn't.
Its a new town and so everyhing is under construction.
I tried to not let it get to me. I walked the streets to see if I could find a cute cafe that I could come to daily to make a bit of a routine.
I didn't find one I liked.... Theres one in my apartment complex but the workers always laugh at me and now I have too much anxiety to go back so thats fun.
